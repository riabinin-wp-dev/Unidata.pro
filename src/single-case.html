                    enhancement in the metrics of their biometric access system for banking programs; the neural network
                    was missing 18% of attacks. According to specifications, the anti-spoofing dataset necessitated a
                    diverse array of mobile devices and accessories (masks, wigs, glasses, scarves, etc.). The client
                    approached us due to their internal team’s unsuccessful experience in data collection, coupled with
                    time constraints regarding the dataset</p>

                <p>Since the biometric system only required refinement for complex and atypical appearance scenarios, we
                    artificially generated 10,000 video attacks. We assembled a team of 20 individuals who created
                    diverse filming conditions, using paper masks and various props. Each assessor simulated attacks
                    involving 500 individuals</p>
